# Route Metric Calculator (RMC)

The route metric calculator is a quick project from my studies in which it was needed to calculate the costs from a source router to a destination. 
This program aims to achieve this goal by using a overgiven file of routes to calculate the routing tables. <br/>

The file needs the following structure: <br/>
source_router destination_router costs
  
## Example configuration:
```
A B 4
A C 4
B D 3
C D 1
D F 5
D E 2
D H 2
E G 1
H G 3
F H 9
```
